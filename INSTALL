Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have Qt 4 installed and working. If you dont know what Qt is,
go to http://qt.nokia.com/products/. You will need qmake to compile.

Building
1. edit kdocker.pro if necessary. It should be ready to go with no change.
2. qmake
3. make 
4. run "make install" (optional)
5. if you did not do a "make install" make sure kdocker is in your $PATH. This
   is required for session management to work.
